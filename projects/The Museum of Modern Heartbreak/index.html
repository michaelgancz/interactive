              Welcome to <i>The Museum of Modern Heartbreak</i>, an open online archive of
              breakup texts, job rejection emails, spam, scams, and unanswered cries
              for help. This archive preserves that
              specific brand of helplessness which arises when we receive some item of
              devastating personal news through the fundamentally impersonal medium
              of online communication.
          </p>
          <p>
              There's an extra twist: you will only be able to view this archive by
              contributing to it. Once you submit the form below, you will be shown
              exactly one entry by some other user. You can spend as much time with
              it as you like, screenshot it, print it, whatever — but if you want to see
              anything else you'll have to refresh the page and
              submit the form again with something new.
              Your submission, if approved, will live anonymously as part of the archive.
          </p>
          <p>
              So, what makes it into the archive? We approve entries that meet the
              following criteria: <br /> <br />
              1) All valid entries are image files — usually text screenshots, but feel free
              to get creative and surprise us with GIFs, evites, and memes. You will not be
              able to submit anything that is not an image, though. <br /> <br />
              2) All proper nouns, including names of people and institutions, are
              redacted. A reader should not be able to piece together any identifying
              information about the parties involved
              in your image. <br /> <br />
              3) Your entry is entirely yours to share. It's not ripped from some
              other corner of the internet, nor does it deal primary with anyone but
              you. <br /> <br />
              4) Lastly, the content of your entry encodes some profound emotion that
              is offset, altered, or made awkward, cold, or hurtful by the medium of its
              presentation.
