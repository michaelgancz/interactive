      <p> Andrea Mazzariello is a composer, performer and educator whose practice runs a fascinating gamut of genera, styles, aesthetics and techniques. I met him online at a composition festival last summer and was struck by his capacity for attentive listening and the genuine humanity of his online presence. In this experimental interview, Andrea was given just under two weeks to answer a set of five open-ended questions. He could answer these questions as honestly or dishonestly, directly or abstractly as he wantedâ€”the only requirement was that each response take the form of a sound clip of Andrea's creation or curation. The interview in full is available below. Learn more about Andrea at
